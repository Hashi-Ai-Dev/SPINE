## What SPINE Is

SPINE is a **repo-native mission governor** for AI coding agents. It sits above the agent and keeps it aligned to a defined mission — not by being smart, but by being explicit.

**Core loop:** Mission → Scope → Proof → Decisions → Drift Check

**Discipline rule:** SPINE should reduce discipline tax not by hiding governance, but by making governance easy for agents and tools to execute explicitly.

**Authority rule:** Agents may execute governance mechanics. Operators retain governance authority.
