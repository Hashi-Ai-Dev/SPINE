## Phase 3B Candidates

### ✅ SPINE_ROOT ergonomics (#73)
**Status:** Done — `spine target` command added. Shows resolved target with source annotation. Documents one-shot `SPINE_ROOT=/path spine <cmd>` pattern. 15 new tests, all passing.

### ✅ Discipline-tax reduction (#74)
**Status:** Done — `spine log <kind> "<description>"` short-form evidence add. Positional args replace verbose `--kind`/`--description` flags. Identical canonical record to `evidence add`. 11 new tests, all passing. Cheatsheet `--rationale` bug fixed.

### 🟡 OpenClaw first-class startup/skill path (#75)
**Status:** Active — Phase 3B candidate

### 🚫 HUD / live observability mode
**Status:** REJECTED

### 🚫 Notification / webhook systems
**Status:** REJECTED

### 🚫 Remote MCP (strategic question — INTERNAL, not yet approved)
**Status:** DEFERRED — Issue #76 — product decision pending
