SPINE is a CLI tool that sits **above** your coding agents, not inside them. It uses a `.spine/` directory — plain YAML and JSONL, version-controlled alongside your code — as the canonical source of truth for what you're building, what's in scope, and what's been decided.

No daemons. No cloud. No model calls.

## Who is this for?

Solo developers and small teams building with AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) who want a lightweight governance layer to:

- Maintain a clear, bounded mission while agents work
- Prevent scope creep from accumulating invisibly
- Keep an auditable log of decisions and evidence
- Generate mission briefs that ground agent sessions

SPINE is strongest today with **Claude Code** and **Codex** — it generates briefing files those tools can load automatically.

## Quickstart

Requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
cd /your/project
git init          # SPINE requires a git repo
uv run spine init

# Define your mission
uv run spine mission set \
  --title "My Project" \
  --status active \
  --scope "backend,api" \
  --forbid "ui,billing"

# Generate a mission brief for Claude
uv run spine brief --target claude

# Run the governance health check
uv run spine doctor
```

That's it. `.spine/` is now your governance contract, version-controlled with the rest of your code.

## Current Alpha Capabilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `spine init` | Scaffold `.spine/` governance state in a git repo |
| `spine mission show` | Display current mission (table or `--json`) |
| `spine mission set` | Update mission fields |
| `spine opportunity score` | Score an opportunity with a weighted 6-factor rubric |
| `spine evidence add` | Append a typed evidence record |
| `spine decision add` | Append a decision record with rationale |
| `spine drift scan` | Detect scope drift using git-native diff (staged + committed) |
| `spine brief --target claude\|codex` | Generate a mission brief for a specific agent |
| `spine review weekly` | Aggregate evidence/decisions/drift into a weekly review |
| `spine doctor` | Validate `.spine/` state and repo contract |
| `spine mcp serve` | Start a local MCP server (stdio mode) |

`--json` output is available on `mission show`, `doctor`, and `review weekly`.

## What `spine init` Creates

```
.spine/
├── mission.yaml        ← Active mission definition
├── constraints.yaml    ← Work schedule, budget, routing rules
├── opportunities.jsonl ← Scored opportunity log
├── not_now.jsonl       ← Deferred ideas
├── evidence.jsonl      ← Evidence log
├── decisions.jsonl     ← Decision record
├── drift.jsonl         ← Drift scan results
├── runs.jsonl          ← Agent run log
├── reviews/            ← Generated weekly reviews
├── briefs/             ← Agent mission briefs
├── skills/             ← Agent skill definitions
└── checks/             ← Automated checks
AGENTS.md               ← Guidance for AI agents in this repo
CLAUDE.md               ← Claude-specific governance rules
```

## Governing an External Repo

SPINE can govern a repo other than the one it's installed in. This is useful when running SPINE as a sidecar governance tool for a separate project.

```bash
# Initialize .spine/ in an external repo
uv run spine init --cwd /path/to/other-repo

# Target all subsequent commands at that repo
SPINE_ROOT=/path/to/other-repo uv run spine doctor
SPINE_ROOT=/path/to/other-repo uv run spine mission show
SPINE_ROOT=/path/to/other-repo uv run spine drift scan
```

`SPINE_ROOT` binds both the canonical state directory and git operations to the same target repo.

## Validation

This alpha was validated against two repos before release:

- **Self-governance:** Full governance loop on SPINE's own repo — mission set, evidence logged, decisions recorded, drift scanned, weekly review and agent briefs generated. Test suite: **123 passed, 0 failed**.
- **External repo (gsn-connector):** `SPINE_ROOT` targeting verified end-to-end across all commands. Drift scan correctly read the external repo's git history. No state pollution between repos.

## Known Limitations

This is alpha software. Known rough edges:

1. `--cwd` works only with `spine init` — all other commands use `SPINE_ROOT` for external targeting.
2. `SPINE_ROOT` is process-global — if set in a shell profile, all commands are affected.
3. No migration tooling yet — this is the first public release.
4. JSONL logs are append-only — no undo or rollback.
5. Single git repo per `.spine/` — cannot govern multiple repos from one state directory.
6. `spine mcp serve` is a local stdio server only — no remote MCP support.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Not in a git repo (`--allow-no-git` to override) |
| 3 | Conflicting existing files (`--force` to overwrite) |

## What's Next

Near-term direction:

- `--cwd` support on all commands (not just `spine init`)
- Richer drift detection beyond git-native diff
- Improved weekly review output
- Migration tooling for `.spine/` state upgrades

Not planned for this alpha: web UI, auth, billing, cloud sync, remote MCP, or multi-user support.

## Alpha Status

This is an **alpha release**. The core command surface is stable and validated, but breaking changes are possible before v1. Do not use in production without review.
