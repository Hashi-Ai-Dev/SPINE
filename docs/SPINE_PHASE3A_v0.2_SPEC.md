# SPINE Phase 3A Specification v0.2 (Planning)

**Status:** Draft for planning and scope control only.  
**Implementation state:** Not started. This document does **not** authorize or imply Phase 3A implementation work.

---

## 1) Why Phase 3A Exists

SPINE v0.1 established and validated the core governance loop: mission control, bounded scope, opportunity scoring, brief generation, evidence and decision logging, drift scanning, and weekly review. Internal use and self-dogfooding confirmed this loop is real and useful.

However, Phase 1–2 success does not yet guarantee smooth adoption on arbitrary repositories. v0.1.1 hardening highlighted practical operator friction: repo targeting ambiguity, branch context confusion, output ergonomics, and artifact discoverability.

Phase 3A exists to solve those practical portability and operations gaps **before** any higher-surface expansion. This keeps SPINE aligned with its product thesis: governance reliability first, novelty later.

This phase is intentionally positioned before dashboard/cloud/swarm directions to avoid repeating the same scope drift SPINE is designed to prevent.

---

## 2) Goals

Phase 3A goals are narrow and operational:

1. **Make SPINE portable across arbitrary repos** with explicit, predictable targeting semantics.
2. **Reduce git-context ambiguity** by making active repo and branch context visible and reliable.
3. **Increase operator confidence** through clear run-time context and deterministic command behavior.
4. **Improve CI/automation friendliness** with machine-readable output and stable exit behavior where appropriate.
5. **Tighten artifact ergonomics** with stable naming and path conventions that simplify inspection and automation.
6. **Improve bootstrap clarity** for first use in non-SPINE repos.
7. **Publish practical docs/examples** for adoption outside SPINE’s own repository.

---

## 3) Non-Goals

Phase 3A explicitly excludes:

- Dashboards, web UIs, or TUI visualization layers
- Remote MCP transport/hosting
- Hosted/cloud sync features
- Authentication, billing, or account systems
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Autonomous orchestration/background agent loops
- Broad adapter expansion or plugin matrix growth
- Model-based scoring, model-based drift classification, or required live-model dependencies
- Any Phase 4/5 roadmap work presented as active scope

---

## 4) Proposed Scope

### 4.1 Explicit repo targeting

**Why it matters**  
Ambiguous working-directory behavior undermines trust and causes accidental writes to the wrong repo.

**Problem solved**  
Operators and CI need to intentionally direct SPINE at a specific repository path every time semantics matter.

**Narrow acceptable implementation shape**  
- Introduce and standardize explicit repo-targeting semantics (e.g., canonical path flag behavior) across Phase 3A-touched commands.
- Normalize and display resolved target path during execution.
- Fail fast with clear errors for invalid or non-repo targets when command requires git context.

**Deferred**  
- Repo discovery “magic” across arbitrary parent directories.
- Multi-repo orchestration from one command invocation.

### 4.2 Repo context and default-branch visibility

**Why it matters**  
Drift and review trust depend on operators knowing exactly which branch and comparison base are active.

**Problem solved**  
Implicit default-branch inference is useful but opaque without explicit reporting.

**Narrow acceptable implementation shape**  
- Standard context reporting format for relevant commands: target repo path, current HEAD branch/detached state, resolved default branch or explicit compare target.
- Clear warning path when default branch cannot be resolved.
- Keep behavior deterministic; prioritize transparent reporting over smart heuristics.

**Deferred**  
- Automatic branch remediation or branch-switching flows.
- Advanced branch graph analytics.

### 4.3 Operator/CI output modes (`--json`, `--quiet`, stable exits)

**Why it matters**  
Human-readable output is not sufficient for CI and scripts.

**Problem solved**  
Operators need parseable output and predictable exit codes.

**Narrow acceptable implementation shape**  
- Add machine-readable output mode where operationally justified.
- Add reduced-noise output mode for healthy-path checks.
- Define and document stable exit behavior for success, validation failures, and runtime/context failures.
- Preserve deterministic semantics and backward-safe defaults.

**Deferred**  
- Event streaming, remote telemetry, or observability platforms.
- Complex output formatting families beyond practical operator use.

### 4.4 Artifact naming and path conventions

**Why it matters**  
Timestamp-only naming is difficult for quick navigation and scripting.

**Problem solved**  
Operators need both stable references and historical records.

**Narrow acceptable implementation shape**  
- Define canonical stable artifact aliases (for “current” assets) alongside history retention.
- Standardize naming pattern(s) and directory layout expectations in docs.
- Keep compatibility with existing artifact history where possible.

**Deferred**  
- Large artifact indexing systems.
- Database-backed artifact catalogs.

### 4.5 Bootstrap/install polish

**Why it matters**  
First-run experience determines adoption in non-SPINE repos.

**Problem solved**  
Initial setup should clearly communicate prerequisites, side effects, and resulting repo contract.

**Narrow acceptable implementation shape**  
- Improve bootstrap/install messaging and guidance for zero-context operators.
- Clarify expected files, minimal workflow, and verification steps.
- Keep install/bootstrap local-first and deterministic.

**Deferred**  
- Hosted installers, managed agents, or background services.

### 4.6 Docs and examples for external repo usage

**Why it matters**  
v0.1 documents SPINE itself well, but operators need direct examples for adopting SPINE in unrelated repos.

**Problem solved**  
Reduce onboarding ambiguity and prevent misuse.

**Narrow acceptable implementation shape**  
- Add concise operator-grade examples for new/adopted repo flow.
- Document explicit targeting patterns, branch context interpretation, and CI usage patterns.
- Include anti-patterns and failure-mode examples.

**Deferred**  
- Broad cookbook ecosystems.
- Framework-specific integration matrices.

## 5) Risks and Anti-Drift Notes

Phase 3A drift risks and required guardrails:

1. **Overbuilding operator UX**  
   Risk: adding complex presentation layers instead of reliability improvements.  
   Guardrail: prioritize explicit context and deterministic behavior over interface novelty.

2. **Dashboard creep**  
   Risk: introducing UI ambitions under the label of “visibility.”  
   Guardrail: retain CLI + file-native governance as the core control surface.

3. **Magical targeting**  
   Risk: clever repo detection that surprises operators.  
   Guardrail: explicit target resolution and clear reporting; avoid hidden fallbacks.

4. **Surface growth before hygiene**  
   Risk: adding new capability area before portability and release ergonomics are stable.  
   Guardrail: phase gate requires operator-grade stability outcomes first.

5. **Implicit Phase 4 pull-forward**  
   Risk: “small” additions that become cloud/auth/collaboration foundations.  
   Guardrail: enforce Non-Goals as hard exclusions for Phase 3A.

---

## 6) Acceptance Criteria

Phase 3A is successful only if all of the following are true:

1. **Explicit external repo targeting is operationally clear** and materially less ambiguous than v0.1 behavior.
2. **Operators can always tell active context** (repo path, current branch state, comparison/default branch for relevant commands).
3. **Machine-readable output is available where justified** and documented for CI use.
4. **Exit behavior is stable and documented** for normal, validation, and context failures.
5. **Artifact references become easier to inspect and automate** via stable naming/path conventions.
6. **Bootstrap/install guidance is clearer for non-SPINE repos** with practical first-run expectations.
7. **Documentation includes concrete external-repo examples** and anti-pattern warnings.
8. **No prohibited surface expansion occurred** (dashboard/cloud/auth/billing/autonomous/multi-user/model-required scope).

---

## 7) Milestone Breakdown (Planning Sequence)

### Phase 3A.1 — Spec finalization + explicit targeting design
- Finalize Phase 3A boundaries and command-level targeting contract.
- Define context-reporting contract fields and error semantics.
- Lock non-goals and drift guardrails.

### Phase 3A.2 — Repo-context clarity
- Implement and validate consistent repo/branch/default-branch visibility on relevant commands.
- Ensure deterministic handling of unresolved default branch states.

### Phase 3A.3 — Operator/CI output polish
- Add machine-readable and quiet output modes where justified.
- Publish stable exit-code behavior and update operator docs.
- Validate scripting reliability in representative local/CI scenarios.

### Phase 3A.4 — Artifact + docs completion
- Finalize stable artifact naming/path conventions.
- Publish external-repo onboarding and usage examples.
- Run final portability validation pass before Phase 3A closeout.

## 8) Recommended First Slice (when implementation is approved)

**Recommended first implementation slice:**  
**Explicit repo targeting + clear repo/branch/default-branch context reporting.**

**Why first:**
- Highest risk-reduction per unit effort.
- Directly addresses correctness and operator trust issues identified in dogfooding.
- Creates the foundation required for meaningful `--json`, CI integration, and artifact ergonomics.
- Prevents follow-on work from inheriting ambiguous targeting behavior.

This first slice should remain narrow: no new product surfaces, no remote capabilities, and no speculative architecture.

---

## 9) Relation to Current State

This Phase 3A planning spec is a direct continuation of:

- **SPINE Official Spec v0.1:** establishes the core governance contract and non-goal posture.
- **SPINE Origin and Product Thesis v0.1:** reinforces SPINE’s role as governance above agents and warns against becoming a sprawl machine.
- **SPINE v0.1.1 Self-Dogfood Cleanup:** surfaces practical operator friction and hardening insights that motivate portability/polish as the next maturity step.
- **External validation gate:** remains the real-world progression criterion; Phase 3A is scoped to improve reliability and usability for that gate, not bypass it.

---

## 10) Planning Status Note

Phase 3A is currently **specified, not approved for implementation in this document**.  
Any implementation must be separately authorized and executed as a bounded follow-on phase.
