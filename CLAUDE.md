# CLAUDE.md — SPINE Governance

## Purpose

This repository uses SPINE for local-first, repo-native mission governance.
`.spine/` is the canonical source of truth for governance state.

## Rules

- Preserve `.spine/` as the canonical source of truth. Never rewrite its files
  silently.
- Read `.spine/mission.yaml` before making non-trivial changes.
- Do not silently expand scope beyond what is defined in `.spine/mission.yaml`.
- Do not add web UI, authentication, billing, or cloud sync unless explicitly
  in scope.
- Run `uv run spine doctor` to verify governance state is valid.
- Run `uv run pytest` before finishing any change session. Fix all failures.
